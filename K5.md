Subject: Request: Generate Keytab for Metric Insight Agent (User Principal Only, No HTTP/ SPN)

Hi Team,

I need your help generating a Kerberos keytab for a service account used by the Metric Insight Remote Agent running on a Windows EC2 server.

Please see the request and explanation below.

⸻

What I need you to do:

Please run this command on a domain controller:

ktpass -princ svc_metricinsight@MI.LOCAL ^
       -mapuser MI\svc_metricinsight ^
       -pass [replace_with_password] ^
       -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL ^
       -crypto AES256-SHA1 ^
       -out C:\kerberos\svc_metricinsight.keytab ^
       -mapop set

Then please securely share the resulting .keytab file.

Why HTTP/hostname or other SPNs are not needed:

We are not setting up a Kerberos service. The EC2 instance is only acting as a Kerberos client — it uses Kerberos to authenticate to a NAS SMB share.

⸻

Quick clarification: User principal vs. Service principal

Type	Example	Used for
User principal	svc_metricinsight@MI.LOCAL	Apps authenticating outbound as clients
Service principal	HTTP/servername or cifs/share	Servers accepting inbound Kerberos auth

	•	Our use case only requires a user principal
	•	We do not need an HTTP/ or cifs/ SPN
	•	The NAS server already has the necessary cifs/hostname SPN — we are connecting to it, not hosting anything

⸻

Summary:
	•	✅ We need a keytab for svc_metricinsight@MI.LOCAL
	•	❌ No HTTP/ or cifs/ SPN is needed on our end
	•	✅ The EC2 app is a Kerberos client, not a service

Let me know once the keytab is ready or if anything is unclear.
