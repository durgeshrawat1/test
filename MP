hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to initiate a discussion around adopting AWS Amplify for our upcoming web and mobile application initiatives. As you know, Amplify provides a managed framework for front-end hosting, CI/CD, and backend integration (API, authentication, storage, etc.) — but before proceeding, I’d like to collaborate with you to ensure our architecture, connectivity, and security requirements are fully aligned.

Context & Objectives

We’re exploring AWS Amplify to streamline our front-end development and deployment processes while maintaining compliance with our internal networking, data residency, and security policies. The goal is to leverage Amplify’s managed services while keeping data flows and access consistent with our enterprise standards.

Key Considerations

To proceed responsibly, I’d like to work together on the following focus areas:
	1.	Private Connectivity
	•	Assess options for hosting Amplify front-end and backend resources (API Gateway, AppSync, Cognito, etc.) within our VPC or via AWS PrivateLink.
	•	Ensure traffic remains inside our private network where feasible and review how Amplify interacts with other internal AWS services (S3, CloudFront, etc.).
	2.	Data Security & Compliance
	•	Evaluate data paths, encryption in transit and at rest, and ensure Amplify’s managed components meet our compliance standards (e.g., [your framework: ISO, SOC2, internal data classification]).
	•	Review how user data, credentials, and logs are handled by Amplify-hosted components.
	3.	DNS & SSL Certificate Management
	•	Confirm that we can integrate our corporate DNS zones (Route 53 private/public zones) instead of Amplify-managed subdomains.
	•	Ensure our internal or ACM-issued SSL certificates are used for all public endpoints and custom domains.
	4.	Operational & Governance Model
	•	Define how Amplify projects fit into our existing account structure, tagging, IAM roles, and CI/CD policies.
	•	Review any audit logging, monitoring, or change management controls needed for Amplify deployments.

Next Steps

I’d appreciate setting up a joint working session to review the proposed architecture, discuss connectivity options, and identify any blockers or required exceptions.
I can prepare a draft architecture diagram and Amplify deployment plan for review ahead of the meeting.

Please let me know:
	•	Who from your teams should be included,
	•	Any pre-read templates or security assessment forms I should complete, and
	•	Your availability for a 60-minute discussion in the next week or two.

Thank you for your time and collaboration. I’m confident that with your input, we can design an Amplify setup that meets our internal controls while enabling faster delivery and scalability.
