During my recent review of our application codebase, I found that we are currently running Next.js version 15.4.1. This version is affected by CVE-2025-66478, a high-severity Remote Code Execution vulnerability in React Server Components.

All Next.js 15.x versions prior to 15.4.8 are vulnerable, and projects using the App Router or server components are directly exposed. The only reliable fix is upgrading to a patched version.

Required action:
Please update Next.js to version 15.4.8 (or the latest available 15.x) and redeploy all environments once the upgrade is complete.

I’m available to help with the upgrade, testing, or any follow-up steps needed.
