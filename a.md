Okay, that changes the context significantly! If you've created a single embedding for an entire dictionary object representing a row (or a combination of columns), the RAG process needs a slight adjustment in thinking, but the core principle remains the same.

Here's the breakdown for your specific scenario:

Embedding Represents the Dictionary: Your vector embedding captures the overall semantic meaning of the entire dictionary object (likely after you converted it to a string format that the Titan model could process).
Vector Search Finds Similar Dictionaries: When you perform $vectorSearch, it will find the DocumentDB documents whose embedded dictionaries are semantically closest to your query's embedding.
Context Retrieval = Retrieving the Dictionary: Instead of retrieving a "text chunk", the goal now is to retrieve the original dictionary object (or the exact string representation you embedded) that corresponds to the found vector.
LLM Needs Dictionary Context: The LLM needs to be given these retrieved dictionary objects as context and instructed on how to answer the question based on the fields within those dictionaries.
Problem & Solution:

Just like before, the RAG system needs access to the data that the vector represents. In your case, this isn't a text chunk, but the original dictionary object itself (or its string representation).

Steps to Implement:

Ensure Dictionary is Stored in DocumentDB:

When you performed the ingestion:

Did you take your dictionary object?
Did you convert it into a specific string format (e.g., using json.dumps(my_dict), str(my_dict), or a custom format)? This format is important.
Did you generate the embedding for that specific string?
Crucially: Did you store the original dictionary (or the exact string representation you embedded) as a field in the DocumentDB document alongside the embedding field?
If you didn't store the original dictionary/string, you need to go back and do so. Your DocumentDB documents should look like this:

JSON

{
  "_id": "record_id_123",
  "embedding": [-0.987, 0.654, ..., 0.321], // Vector for the dictionary below
  "record_data": { // Storing the original dictionary object
    "column1": "value A",
    "column2": 123,
    "description": "Some details about this record",
    "status": "active"
  },
  // OR, store the exact string you embedded:
  // "record_data_string": "{\"column1\": \"value A\", \"column2\": 123, ...}"
  "metadata": { // Optional
    "source_table": "my_table"
  }
}
Storing the original dictionary object ("record_data": {...}) is often more flexible, but you need to be sure how you serialized it for embedding if you need to re-generate embeddings later. Storing the exact string ("record_data_string": "...") guarantees you have what was embedded, but might be less convenient for other uses. Choose one approach and be consistent.

Update Existing Documents (If Needed):

If your current documents only have the embedding field, you must update them to include the record_data (or record_data_string) field containing the original dictionary/string representation. As before, this might require reprocessing your source data.
Configure the RAG Script:

Modify the configuration section of the Python script. Instead of DOCDB_TEXT_FIELD, use a name that reflects you're retrieving the dictionary/record data. Let's call it DOCDB_DATA_FIELD.
Point this variable to the actual field name in your DocumentDB documents.
Python

# --- Configuration ---
# ... other config ...
DOCDB_VECTOR_FIELD = "embedding"
DOCDB_DATA_FIELD = "record_data" # OR "record_data_string" - MATCH YOUR FIELD NAME!
DOCDB_METADATA_FIELD = "metadata"
# ... rest of config ...
Modify the RAG Script (search_documentdb and perform_rag):

In search_documentdb, change the $project stage to retrieve the correct data field:
Python

# Inside search_documentdb function:
    {
        '$project': {
            '_id': 0,
            'data': f'${DOCDB_DATA_FIELD}', # Retrieve the dictionary/string data
            'metadata': f'${DOCDB_METADATA_FIELD}',
            'score': { '$meta': 'vectorSearchScore' }
        }
    }
In perform_rag, update the context preparation to handle the retrieved data (which might be a dictionary or a string needing parsing):
Python

# Inside perform_rag function, step 3:
print("3. Preparing context...")
context_data_list = []
if not search_results:
    print("   No relevant records found in DocumentDB or search failed.")
    # Decide how to handle this - maybe pass "No relevant records found."
    context_string = "No relevant records found in the database."
else:
    print(f"   Retrieved {len(search_results)} relevant record(s):")
    for i, res in enumerate(search_results):
        retrieved_data = res.get('data') # This is your dictionary or string
        score = res.get('score', -1.0)
        metadata_info = res.get('metadata', '{}')
        print(f"      Result {i+1}: Score={score:.4f}, Metadata={metadata_info}, Data Type={type(retrieved_data)}")
        # Convert dictionary to a clear string format for the LLM
        if isinstance(retrieved_data, dict):
            # Example: Convert dict to a readable string (JSON is good)
            context_data_list.append(json.dumps(retrieved_data, indent=2))
        elif isinstance(retrieved_data, str):
             # If it's already the string you embedded, use it directly
             # Or potentially parse it if it's JSON stored as a string
            try:
                # Try parsing if it's JSON string, then format nicely
                parsed_dict = json.loads(retrieved_data)
                context_data_list.append(json.dumps(parsed_dict, indent=2))
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                # If it's not JSON, just use the raw string
                context_data_list.append(retrieved_data)
        else:
            context_data_list.append(f"[Unsupported data format: {type(retrieved_data)}]")

    # Combine the string representations of the retrieved records
    context_string = "\n\n---\n\n".join(context_data_list) # Separate records clearly
    print(f"   Context prepared (total length: {len(context_string)} chars).")

# Step 4 (Construct Prompt) needs the 'context_string' generated above
# ... use context_string in the prompt ...
Adapt the LLM Prompt: This is VERY important. The LLM needs to know it's receiving structured data, not free text.

Python

# Inside perform_rag function, step 4:
print("4. Constructing prompt for LLM...")
# Adjust prompt for dictionary/record context
prompt = f"""You are an AI assistant. Your task is to answer the user's question based *only* on the following data record(s) provided in JSON format.
Do not use any prior knowledge.
Analyze the fields within the JSON record(s) to find the answer.

Data Record(s):
--- START DATA ---
{context_string}
--- END DATA ---

Question: {user_query}

Answer:"""
print("   Prompt constructed.")
```

In essence: You need to store the original dictionary (or its exact string representation used for embedding) in DocumentDB alongside the vector. Then, modify the RAG script to retrieve this data field and format it clearly (e.g., as a JSON string) within a prompt that explicitly tells the LLM to interpret the provided structured data.
