wanted to share a quick update on the work completed so far for the Accelerated Intelligent Document Processing on AWS solution (GitHub link).

Work Completed:
	1.	Terraform Conversion:
The entire codebase has been successfully converted to Terraform for easier integration with our infrastructure-as-code practices.
	2.	Compliance Review:
Since certain AWS services like Serverless EMR are not approved in our organization, I reviewed the architecture and removed all unsupported resources from the codebase.
	3.	Enablement of Approved Services:
For services that are approved but not yet enabled in our environment, I worked on enabling them in the lab setup as part of the preparation.
	4.	Deployment:
I’ve completed the deployment for Pattern 1 of the solution. However, testing could not be performed due to the use of AWS AppSync, which is not currently approved in our organization.

Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough of the Terraform implementation or if we should explore alternatives to AppSync for testing and production readiness.



✅ Work Completed So Far:
	1.	Terraform Conversion:
The complete solution codebase has been converted to Terraform, aligning with our infrastructure-as-code standards.
	2.	Service Compliance Review:
Removed components that rely on services not approved in our organization (e.g., Serverless EMR).
For services that are approved but not yet enabled, I worked on enabling them in the lab environment.
	3.	Initial Deployment:
Deployed the solution for Pattern 1. However, AppSync, which is a dependency in this pattern, is not approved in our environment—so we were unable to run end-to-end test cases.
	4.	Lambda Cleanup & Dependency Handling:
	•	Several Lambda functions in the repo lacked proper requirements.txt definitions, leading to dependency issues.
	•	We are currently cleaning up and restructuring the Lambda code to properly define and install dependencies.
	•	A few Lambda functions exceeded the size limit due to large dependencies; for those, we are creating and integrating Lambda layers to manage package size constraints.
